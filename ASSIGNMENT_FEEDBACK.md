Hi Pernilla!

Thanks for fixing the contact form. The only very minor thing missing is that the "message" input should also be a required input. Fix it if you like, but you've already demonstrated that you undertand how to make a field required (as well as every other requirement of the assignemnt), so I am happy to say you've covered all the requirements for a Välgodkänt grade, and there is no ned to resubmit.

Congratulations! And once again this is a great looking and working site, you have a talent for this.

Hi Pernilla!

Although the design is not assessed in this assignment I have to say your site looks very, very nice! The coding is first rate and you should be proud of what you have produced. As you can see below you have ticked off nearly all the requirements of the assignment.

Unfortunately it appars to have been some slight misunderstanding regarding the contact form - please see the comment below.

It's clear you have a good understanding of html and css, but I have to grade everyone on the same criteria, so I can't consider your assignmnt complete until the contact form is working as intended. Could you please fix the content form and let me know when the github repo is updated?

A navigational menu every page with links to the other pages: ✅

Contact form: ❌

    Required:
    Mail to:
  I see the register form but perhaps there has been some confusion about what is required.

  The site should contain a contact form that generates an email template when the submit button is clicked, with the user name & email automatically added to the email template. If the name & email have not been filled in the form should not submit. On submit what should happen is my email client should automatically start up. This site shows what is required:
